List Of ideas:

The New York Times is a daily newspaper based in New York City with a worldwide readership reported in 2022 to comprise 740,000 paid print subscribers,
and 8.6 million paid digital subscribers.

Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the Times was initially published by Raymond, Jones & Company.

On September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to The New-York Times. The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.

Later Expansion:

Ochs died in 1935 and was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger.[43] Under his leadership, and that of his son-in-law (and successor), Orvil Dryfoos, the paper extended its breadth and reach, beginning in the 1940s. On June 22, 1941 The New York Times published an abridged English translation of the German declaration of war on the Soviet Union.[46] The newspaper's crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section first appeared in 1946. The New York Times began an international edition in 1946 (the international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when The New York Times joined the owners of the New York Herald Tribune and The Washington Post to publish the International Herald Tribune in Paris).

After only two years as publisher, Dryfoos died in 1963[47] and was succeeded[48] by his brother-in-law, Arthur Ochs "Punch" Sulzberger, who led the Times until 1992 and continued the expansion of the paper.[

Digital era

The New York Times switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year.[60] In 1983, the Times sold the electronic rights to its articles to LexisNexis. As the online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the Times decided not to renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles.On January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.

2000s
In August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from 13.5 inches (34 cm) to a 12 inches (30 cm). This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12 million a year.

Organization:
Meredith Kopit Levien has been president and chief executive officer since September 2020.

In addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong.[132][133] Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in 2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office. The paper also has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.

As of 2013, the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States, and 24 in other countries
